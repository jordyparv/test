For the contact section, we need to pull data from OpsTracker and map the contact column with the correct contact details. This is because the switch location table contains contact details like tech_name_1 and tech_name_2, while the IOP (Integrated Operations Platform) has row-based data. Due to this, in the development server, when the Ops DB connection is established, it pulls data from the dev environment. However, the reverse API updates the data in the production environment. As a result, when we update or delete a contact, there is a mismatch because the data is mapped based on the dev environment, but the update occurs in production.
