Dear Animesh,

I hope youâ€™re doing well. Unfortunately, I have injured my leg and am unable to walk, making it difficult for me to commute to the office. Given the situation, I would like to request to work from home for the next two days, 6/2/2025 and 7/2/2024 while I recover.

I have also applied for work from home on OTG.

Thank you for your understanding.
Best regards,
